            Sprinters engage their fast-twitch muscles that are powered by anaerobic respiration, providing sudden spurts of ATP. 
            <br>
            How do these muscles contract at such rapid rates?

            The nerve axon releases the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine into the sarcolemma, which contains pores which are the neuromuscular junction.
            This amino acid binds to the receptor dihydropyridine found in the sarcolemma. 
            This membrane passes into the muscle cells as columnar t-tubules which are extensions of the sarcolemma. 
            This opens cation channels in the t-tubule, letting Sodium ions enter and depolarise the cell. 
            The t-tubule is flanked on both sides by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). 
            Depolarisation of the DHRP leads to excitation coupling of the ryanodine receptor in the SR. 
            s4 segment on alpha subunit of l1 type calcium channel has positively charge argigine and lysine on 3rd positonl leading to charge snesor 
            When the membrane depolarizes, the S4 helix moves through the S4 and S5 linkers to the cytoplasmic ends of the S5 and S6 helices. 
            This opens the activation gate which is formed by the inner side of the S6 helices in the Î±1 subunit.
            The ryanodine voltage gated channels open, releasing stored Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions through its terminal cisternae.

        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20;"> 
            Muscle cells are made up of myofibrils, with thin and thick filaments. 
            The thick filament is myosin and the thin filament is actin.
            Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions bind to a globular molecule, troponin, which pulls the alpha helical tropomyosin down. 
            This exposes the binding site on actin for myosin heads.
            The ATP attached to the myosin head is hydrolysed with the catalystic element mg.
            This releases adp and P<sub>i</sub>.
            The myosin flexes pulling the actin filament closer. This forms the famed <i>cross-bridges</i>. 
            <span style="color: green">That's why when muscles contract, they are said to be shorter and wider. </span>
            This cycle is repeated, with ATP binding to the myosin head, removing it from the actin. 
            Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are pumped back into the SR through terminal pumps or channels. 
        </p>
        <h3 align="center"> Sliding Filament Theory</h3>
        <p>
            The sliding filament theory is the most widely accepted explanation for how this occurs. 
            According to this theory, muscle contraction is a cycle of molecular events in which thick myosin filaments repeatedly attach to and pull on thin actin filaments, so they slide over one another.
            The actin filaments are attached to Z discs, each of which marks the end of a sarcomere.
            The sliding of the filaments pulls the Z discs of a sarcomere closer together, thus shortening the sarcomere.
            As this occurs, the muscle contracts.
