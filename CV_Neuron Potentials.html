resting 
graded- stimulus chemical firing of action or not 
action- may or may not , voltage gated, 
synaptic activity
na and k pump, permeaibltiy of ions 
resting:
    -70mv
    more K on the inside more plus
    na+ and cl- outside
    leak channel , chemical graident so K goes out 
    separation chargne, electricl, negatve insdie, 
    outside psoitive k will repel each toher
    would want to mvoe isndie negative 
    chemcial gradient falls, eelctrical rises,
    then K mgiht come back in 
    eelctrocemical grdietn 
    leak channel for na as well, electrochemcia lgradient , na comnig in 
    keeps hapnpeing and potential would disappear 
    but we have na/k pump + atp , send 3 na out for 2 k in, 
    votlage gated channel as well, popylpetide attahced, when volt approahc -55, it opens
        huge na coming in 
        depolarise neuron, climb to + mv
    move away from -55, + values deactivated
    k gated chane,s +30, k move out 
    repolaristion
    takes time to close, undershoot, 
    leak channels again reestalbish 

    ionotropic receptors 
    metabotropic receptors
