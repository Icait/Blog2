    <title>Synthetic Insulin</title>

<body style="margin-right: 150px; margin-left: 150px;"> 
    <h1> How did mankind make synthetic Insulin</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Synthetic insulin has been with us for some decades now and Diabetes even longer. 
                How did we make the leap? From discovering hormones like insulin, understanding their structure, to making our very hormone. 
                From decoding our body's carefully controlled mechanisms to implementing them.
            </p> 
            <h3 style="font-size: 25px;"> To mimic someone, is to understand it. Hence, let us understand insulin's build up.</h3>

            Insulin, compared to most other proteins, is acutally quite a small 51 amino acid long chain, made of 2 peptide.
            An A-chain and a B-chain which are 21 and 30 amino acids long respectively. 
            As they are shorter than 50 amino acids, they are not considered as POLYpeptides.
            The 2 cysteine amino acids in both the peptides form 2 disulphide bonds, which gives insulin its tertiary structure.

            Sulfur has 6 electrons in its outer orbital. 
            Hence, it forms a covalent bond by sharing two electrons with another Sulfur atom. 
            The cysteine on the same chain are linked by intra-chain disulphide bridges whereas the other two are inter-chain disulphide bridges.
            The intra chain link causes the peptide to bend.
