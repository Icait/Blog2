Three of the PD-related genes - PARK1, PARK2, andPARK5 - code for proteins found in LBs.
Two of these - parkin (the product of PARK2) and UCH-L1 (the product, of PARK5) - 
are enzymatic components of the UPS for intracellular protein clearance.
The third is α-synuclein, the product, of PARK1 and a presynaptic protein that, in the fibrillar form, 
constitutes roughly 40% of a typical LB.
A fourth gene, PARK7, codes for DJ-1,
 a protein linked to oxidative stress defenses and possible chaperone functions that could help to limit, 
 misfolding of other proteins and thereby reduce proteolytic stress.
 The fifth PD gene, NR4A2 (also known by its product's name, NURR1),
 encodes a protein that regulates transcription of the TH gene and 
 whose postmitotic expression is critical to the specification and development of midbrain DA neurons.
 Defects in this gene could lead to striatal DA depletion and the characteristic motor impairments of PD, 
 but of course such mutations by themselves would not account for the neurodegenerative process in PD,
  which invariably extends well beyond the midbrain and affects numerous types of nondopaminergic cell groups
