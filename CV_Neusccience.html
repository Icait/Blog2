polarised: action at -55mv
denrites input soma
axon terminal output synapses
electrical synapse: less common 
    pores ions pass, quciekr, synchroniciity 
chemical synapse: chemical released in synaptc cleft , downstream neuron takes it in, depoalrise membrane, 
    chemcia lt electricl, slwoer, more compelx signaling, 
sufficient depolarisatino fo cell membrane to initiate action potential then ti is sent down the axon
propagatinog to another neuron 
intercade is called a snyapse between denrite and axon 
deceptive synaptic physiology in neurological and psychriatic disorders 
synapses targeted  by psychoactive drugs, posion, change over time in response to external stimuli
how we learn and remeber
chemical:
    neurotrasnmitters
    chemcially gated channels
    presynaptic neuron, 
    presynaptic veiscles inside terminal button(end of axon, belwo myelin sheath), 
        votlage gated ca2+ channels on temrinal button
        docking proteins for vesicles 
    synaptic clefpt, 
    postsynpatic vesicles, 
        receptors 
    aciton potential comes down, opens the ca channels 
    electrochemical graident into nueron, so ca comes in 
    ca dock with chemicals on the surface of vesicles 
    activate proteins on thsoe srufaces
    connect with docknig proteins on termnial surface
    vesicle membranes merge
    dumb neurotransmitters
    dock with chemmicall gated hcnanels on the other side, receptors
    neurotransmtiterd may break down or recycled into the synaptic veiscles
    excitatory neurotransmitters increasing voltage, enaring action threshold of -55 from -70
    post synaptic allows Na to flow in 
    na depolrises and clsoe to action 
    INHIBITORY , allow flow of inos that move away from action , release K or take in Cl, 
    CHANNELS:
    leak channels for na and K estalbsih resting potential 
    voltage gated channelt to transmit actino potential
    chemical gated channels- receptors, neutransmitters open it up 
    can move toards or further from action potential
electrical:
    voltage gated channels
    no control 
remeber:
    long term potentiation
    keep firing neuron on post synpatic site, cell devleosp more receptors  
    pathways of memroy over time
