        Deafferentation is the interruption or elimination of sensory nerve impulses.
        Deafferentation pain is defined as “pain due to loss of sensory input into the central nervous system

    <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the midbrain, 
        causing a progressive loss of dopamine (DA) neurons. 
        This loss of DA neurons, or dopaminergic deafferentation, can lead to characteristic motor disturbances. 
        Studies have found that brains from Parkinson's patients have over 50% fewer dopaminergic neurons in
         the midbrain than age-matched controls. [1]

        Cell loss is most profound in the lateral half of the ventral tier of neurons in the SNc,

        Neuromodulators are substances that do not directly activate ion-channel receptors but that, 
        acting together with neurotransmitters, enhance the excitatory or inhibitory responses of the receptors

        The suspected causal factors in PD include environmental toxins, particularly enhancers of oxidative stress,
         and nuclear genetic defects. 
        Evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD ensured that defective mitochondrial genes linked to PD
         would be sought assiduously in PD patients, yet to date there is still no compelling evidence for such a link. 
         On the other hand, studies of families in which the inheritance of PD follows mendelian patterns 
         have already identified five genes in which mutations arc associated with typical PD phenotypes

            The fifth PD gene, NR4A2 (also known by its product's name, NURR1),
             encodes a protein that regulates transcription of the TH gene and
              whose postmitotic expression is critical to the specification and development of midbrain DA neurons.
             Defects in this gene could lead to striatal DA depletion and the characteristic motor impairments of PD
             Tyrosine is the precursor of the catecholamines, 
             converted to dopamine via L-Dopa and the enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) 
             Nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (NURR1) levels decrease during normal aging, 
             which is a major risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD)

    <h3> NURR1 pathway</h3>
    <p>NURR1 interacts with other factors that are important for the survival of dopaminergic neurons, 
        including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT), vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2),
         and l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). 
        NURR1 also plays an important role in inhibiting neuronal death by suppressing inflammatory gene expression in microglia and astrocytes.</p>
        NURR1-deficient cells initially express certain DA neural markers,
