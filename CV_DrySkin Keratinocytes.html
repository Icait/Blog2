            The keratinocytes(keratin) secrete NMF or Natural Moisturising Factor in the granum layer.
            These chemicals maintain skin elasitcity, activate hydrolytic enzymes and act as a barrier for our skin. 
            Hydrolytic enzymes then help destroy dead cells and desquamate them or shred them. 
            The NMF is made up of water and humectants, substances that absorb atmospheric water. 
            Thereby, in less humid conditions, lack of water makes the skin dry.

            A protein called Filaggrin is another important component of NMF as it binds corneocytes(keratinocytes in the stratum corneum).

        <h3 align="center">Odland Bodies</h3> 
        <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 20;">
            Odland bodies are lamellar strucutres that are ovoid shaped and 200-300nm long.  
            They are found in the spinous and granulosum layer. 
            They separate from the Golgi body, move in the cytosol then latch onto the plasma membrane, releasing their contents into the intercellular space.
            They help maintain anti-microbial immunity, skin desquamation and increase epidermal permeability.

                            <li> Anti-microbial immunity: 2-defensins is a 64 amino acid long protein. Its strong electrostatic charge protects the skin against Gram-negative bacteria.
                                They latch on and increase the pathogen's membrane permeability, killing it. 
                                The protein also contains enoguh cysteine which is essential for immuntiy. It acts in places showing inflammatory response. 
                                It also triggers stem cells to differnetiate into epithelial cells to regenerate skin. </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Epidermal permeability: They release polar lipids like glucosylceramides, phospholipids, sphingomyelinase and cholesterol.  
                                Enzymes like lipid hydrolases convert these lipid precursors into non polar lipids. Non polar lipids prevent water loss from inside cells.
                                They happen to be surfactants, which means they reduce surface tension of any liquid, helping increase the skin's permeability and absorbancy of skincare. 
                                Glycerol is also released from the phospholipid that helps store water.

                            <li>Desquamation: Glycosidases are markers of a cell ready for apoptosis. Cathepsins help in damaging cell organelles. 
                                Serine protease decomposes cell adhesion molecules and cleaves peptide bonds. 
                                This breaks the intercellular adhesion and hence helps in desquamation </li>
