        <h1>Trigeminal Headache or Sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia or Brain freeze? </h1>
        <p> Caitlin Snow : Trigeminal headache. Brain freeze. Cisco Ramon : Then why don't you just call it a brain freeze? 
            Brain freeze is a resultant of trigeminal headache. 
            The process begins with dilation of meningeal arteries, leading to activation of neurons in the trigeminal ganglion, which propagate nociceptive signals to the brain stem.
            These signals then ascend to neurons in the thalamus and eventually reach the cortex, where they are processed and perceived as migraine pain.
            Our trigeminal nerves carry information from our face to the brain. 
            When you consume something cold like ice cream, heat from the palate of your mouth is lost.
            The drop in temperature causes blood vessels to constrict to increase the temperature again. 
            Brain arteries dilate to send more blood to warm the region. vasodilation due to myosin-light-chain phosphatase 
            like the forehead and behind the eyes, in the area between the skull and the brain called the meninges.
            Sudden expansion of arteries activates the trigeminal nerve, sending a pain signal to the brain through the trigmenal nerve. 
            The pain occurs in the frontal lobe. 
            Cooling of the capillaries of the sinuses by a cold stimulus, which results in vasoconstriction (a narrowing of the blood vessels).
A quick rewarming by a warm stimulus such as the air, which results in vasodilation (a widening of the blood vessels).
        </p>
        <h3> Cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD)</h3>
        <p>
            Cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) occurs after cold exposure, possibly to reduce the risk of injury. 
            It can take place in several locations in the human body but is observed most often in the extremities. 
            The fingers are especially common because they are exposed most often.[citation needed]

            When the fingers are exposed to cold, vasoconstriction occurs first to reduce heat loss, resulting in strong cooling of the fingers. 
            Approximately five to ten minutes after the start of the cold exposure of the hand, the blood vessels in the finger tips will suddenly vasodilate.
            This is probably caused by a sudden decrease in the release of neurotransmitters from the sympathetic nerves to the muscular coat of the arteriovenous anastomoses due to local cold. The CIVD increases blood flow and subsequently the temperature of the fingers. 
            This can be painful and is sometimes known as the 'hot aches' which can be painful enough to bring on vomiting.[citation needed]

            A new phase of vasoconstriction follows the vasodilation, after which the process repeats itself. 
            This is called the Hunting reaction. 
            Experiments have shown that three other vascular responses to immersion of the finger in cold water are possible: 
            a continuous state of vasoconstriction; slow, steady, and continuous rewarming; 
            and a proportional control form in which the blood vessel diameter remains constant after an initial phase of vasoconstriction. 
            However, the vast majority of responses can be classified as the Hunting reaction
            The rostral ventrolateral medulla oblongata (RVLM) in the brain controls vasoconstriction, heart rate, and arterial pressure. 
            The RVLM contains sympathetic premotor neurons for the cardiovascular system

        <h3> Noiception </h3>
        <p> Nociception is the processing of noxious stimuli, such as tissue injury and temperature extremes, by the central nervous system
            (CNS) and peripheral
            nervous system (PNS). This activates nociceptors
            and their pathways
           , and pain is the subjective experience
            one feels as a result </p>
        <h3> Trigeminal Nerve and Referred pain</h3>
        <p>
            The sudden contraction and relaxation of nerves puts varying pressures on the nerve, stimulating it.
            Internal Carotid Artery - blood to the whole brain
            Anterior Cerebral Artery- front of brain and along brain tissues 
            It is called so as you don't feel pain in your mouth but your forehead. 
            Whether the nerve is specifically responding to the cold or a sudden reduction of blood and oxygen supply to the brain or both is unclear
        </p>
        <h3> Heating it up</h3>
        <p>
            To stop brain freeze, one can try the following:
            Pressing your tongue against the top of your mouth
            Drinking room-temperature water
            Slowly eating ice cream or drinking milkshakes
